Pet Palace – JavaScript 2 Course Assignment

This project is my submission for the JavaScript 2 Course Assignment at Noroff.
It is a multipage front-end application built with Vite and TypeScript, using the Noroff Social API for authentication, posts, profiles, and user interactions.

The application allows users to register, log in, create posts, edit and delete their own posts, view profiles, follow/unfollow users, and search among posts.
